# Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, find the first occurrence of the target and return its index. Return -1 if the target is not in the array.

# Input:

# arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 10, 10, 10, 100]
# target = 3
# Output: 1

# Explanation: The first occurrence of 3 is at index 1.

# Input:

# arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
# target = 6
# Output: -1

# Explanation: 6 does not exist in the array.
